\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Path planning for a single agent has long been considered a solved problem.
When multiple agents have to find their way through a shared space then the
problem becomes more complicated. Not only do the agents have to find paths
around obstacles, they also need to ensure that they do not collide with each
other. It is also possible that congestions or even deadlocks may occur. To
avoid this there is a need for coordination between the agents.
Cooperative pathfinding finds its application in robotics, aviation, road
traffic management, crowd simulations, and video games \cite{standley2011}.

%TODO: Discuss cooperative pathfinding and abstract solutions.
The most straightforward approach to the cooperative pathfinding problem is to
search the Cartesian product of the state spaces of all agents. Unfortunately
this approach is very inefficient \cite{sharon2013}, the time to find a
solution is exponential
in the number of agents. Another common approach is to assign all agents a
priority. Agents then plan in descending order of priority, they consider
agents with a higher priority to be a moving obstacle and avoid planning
movements that conflict with those of higher priority agents. Both of these
approaches are abstract, there is often no clear reason why a certain solution
was the one arrived at. The algorithm has found a set of conflict free paths
and that set was returned as the working solution without any indication about
the considerations of why it is a good plan.

Most algorithms are of a centralized nature. They either use a central
processor to plan for all the agents, or they need to establish a priority
ordering centrally and agents can then make their own plans but this still
requires agents to keep communicating with all other agents about their
planning.There are also decentralized approaches where agents only communicate
in a small range. This has the problem that there is no global view of the
problem, so agents can make decisions early on that will lead to congestions or
deadlocks later on without any agent noticing.

%TODO: Discuss how partial global planning gives local to global view, and
%allows for cooperation.
Partial global planning has been used in distributed sensor networks to
distribute and coordinate tasks among the nodes that make up the network
\cite{durfee1991}. The nodes create their individual plans without regard for
each other. They will then exchange information on their plans and adapt them
to better coordinate their activities. Nodes can even take over each others
tasks to spread the computational load. Coordination is not rigid, nodes have
some freedom in how they execute their plan if circumstances change without
having to re-coordinate with the other nodes. None of the involved nodes ever
has a global view, but the end result is a plan that is globally coordinated
with each node holding a part of the global plan.

This method of constructing a global plan from local views can also be applied
to cooperative pathfinding. Agents only have to coordinate with those agents
that they have a conflict with. The freedom in planning allows agents to find
alternative paths without having to update all other agents that were ever
coordinated with. This allows for a truly decentralised approach,
agents only communicate with other agents when they have to, and there is no
need to wait for a central processor to tell agents what to do.

%TODO: Discuss how argumentation adds reasons for solutions.
Formal models of argumentation have been used in Artificial Intelligence to
reason about topics like expert systems, multi-agent systems and law
\cite{vaneemeren2014}.
An important concept in argumentation is that of defeasible reasoning: the
conclusion that can be drawn from a set of premises does not need to hold when
additional premises are added. This is in contrast with classical logic where
adding additional premises will never invalidate a conclusion. Defeasible
reasoning allows arguments to be made for or against a conclusion. Arguments
can also support or attack each other and thereby strengthen or weaken a
case for a conclusion.

Commonly reasoning in a multi-agent system is modelled as a dialogue game. In
such a dialogue game the agents represent the players and the game rules
prescribes how the dialogue should occur \cite{walton1995}. There are rules
about what
arguments agents can put forward, when they are allowed to do so, and there can
even be rules about which agent gets to speak when. Most forms of dialogue
games also have rules about when the dialogue is finished and which agent(s)
have won if applicable. These dialogues can be used to give reasons about why a
group of agents decided to take a certain course of action. They can thus be
used to remove some of the abstractness of cooperative pathfinding solutions by
giving reasons why this course of action was arrived at.

%TODO: describe how to combine these three views

The rest of this thesis is structured as follows. First, a formal description
of the cooperative pathfinding problem is given in \autoref{sec:problem}.
Previous work in cooperative pathfinding, argumentation and partial global
planning is discussed in \autoref{sec:related}. A new method to find
conflict-free paths is proposed in \autoref{sec:method}. This method is
evaluated and compared to other algorithms in \autoref{sec:results}. Final
remarks on the proposed method and its implications are discussed in
\autoref{sec:discussion}.
