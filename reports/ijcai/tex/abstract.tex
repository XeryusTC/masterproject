Cooperative pathfinding research studies coordination algorithms addressing 
congestions, deadlocks, and collisions in multi-agent systems. 
In typical algorithms individual agents have no say in resolving conflicts. We 
propose algorithms in which agents engage in an argumentative dialogue in case 
of local conflicts, leading to the transparent and fast construction of global 
solutions. 
We combine ideas from computational argumentation and multi-agent coordination. 
From computational argumentation we use argumentative deliberation dialogues in 
which agents discuss and resolve conflicting local plans. 
From the study of multi-agent coordination we use partial global planning, a 
distributed method to incrementally create a global plan. 
We show that our algorithms generally solve cooperative pathfinding problems 
faster than a state of the art complete and optimal algorithm, at the 
cost of slightly longer path lengths and gaining the explanatory power of 
argumentation dialogues.
