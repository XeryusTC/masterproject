Cooperative pathfinding research studies coordination algorithms addressing 
congestions, deadlocks, and collisions in multi-agent systems. 
In typical algorithms individual agents have no say in resolving conflicts. We 
propose algorithms in which agents engage in a dialogue in case 
of local conflicts, taking inspiration from computational argumentation and 
multi-agent coordination. 
From computational argumentation we use consensus-forming deliberation 
dialogues in 
which agents propose and resolve conflicting local plans (without exchanging 
explicit arguments). 
From the study of multi-agent coordination we use partial global planning, a 
distributed method to incrementally create a global plan. 
We show that our algorithms generally solve cooperative pathfinding problems 
faster than a state of the art complete and optimal algorithm, at the 
cost of slightly longer path lengths and gaining the explanatory power of 
deliberation dialogues.
