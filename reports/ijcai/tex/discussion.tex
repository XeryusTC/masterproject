A qualitative comparison of the features of various cooperative pathfinding algorithms from 
the literature (as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro}) and those presented here is given in 
\autoref{tbl:planning-overview}. Algorithms come in three \emph{categories} of how  they 
calculate a set of paths: centralized, decoupled or decentralized. 
Algorithms can be \emph{complete} or not, depending on whether they find a solution if one exists. Some algorithms impose a \emph{priority} ordering on 
the agents. The 
\emph{communication} column indicates restrictions on which agents are allowed 
to communicate with each other. Finally the \emph{evaluation} column indicates whether 
agents can evaluate a plan by voting. The table shows that our three algorithms PCA*, DPCA* and DPCA*+ are decentralized, not complete, use a priority ordering and involve communication between all agents, while DPCA* and DPCA*+ allow the agents to evaluate plans.

The experimental outcomes in Figures~\ref{fig:perfgraph} and~\ref{fig:solved} show that PCA* took the most 
time and solved the fewest problem instances of the algorithms compared, including OD+ID for most instances. An explanation is that the algorithm 
evaluates all permutations of partial priority orderings and selects one that has
minimal cost, without considering side-effects. This finding led to the development of DPCA* and DPCA*+, in fact the fastest among those that were evaluated, showing the effectiveness of deliberation 
dialogues in this setting.

The slight difference between DPCA* and DPCA*+ in \autoref{fig:perfgraph} shows a tradeoff between computational resources and solution quality: DPCA* solves somewhat more problem 
instances while DPCA*+ finds solutions with slightly shorter path lengths.
The added computational cost of the more complex dialogues involving more than two agents that are available only in DPCA*+ leads to solutions with somewhat shorter paths. In~\autoref{fig:conflict-sizes} we see that these dialogues are much more rare than dialogues between 2 agents. 

Conventional algorithms find an abstract solution for a pathfinding problem based on minimal cost. DPCA* and DPCA*+ add transparency to solution process by the dialogues in which agents can put forward arguments for or against 
partial 
priority orderings. Agents also evaluate and vote on each proposal based on several 
criteria. This gives agents some influence over which solution 
is picked for a problem instance. For an outside observer, the agents' arguments and evaluations provide an explanation why a group of agents have picked a particular 
solution. 

The four stages of DPCA* and DPCA*+ deliberation dialogues are based on the 
four stages of \textsc{TeamLog}~\cite{dunin-keplicz2011}. The extended dialogue model of 
McBurney \emph{et al.}~\shortcite{mcburney2007} is less abstract and remains closer to natural dialogues, but is not necessary to find 
priority orders for the agents. 
%By basing our algorithms on the decoupled method we separated 
%finding paths from 
%the argumentative process. 
%The ordering proposals influence which possible 
%paths are valid but they do not directly alter a path. 

\textsf{DeLP-POP} and \textsf{DeLP-MAPOP}~\cite{pardo2011,ferrando2012} can be regarded as an argumentative adaptation of OD+ID for general multi-agent planning, whereas our algorithms are confined to the abstract setting of cooperative pathfinding discussed in Section~\ref{sec:problem}.
%It is possible to use 
%\textsf{DeLP-MAPOP} to integrate planning and the deliberation process more 
%closely. In this case the agents can discuss individual actions in a plan and 
%propose alternate courses of action. This would result in an algorithm that 
%would be similar to a distributed version of OD+ID. It would also mean that the 
%paths are more tightly coupled than they are in our proposal. As a result 
%agents would be less flexible to change their plan to resolve other conflicts.
%
%Partial global planning ensures that all of our proposed algorithms 
%incrementally build towards a global well coordinated plan from the optimal 
%plans of individual agents. Because we incrementally construct a global plan we 
%can start deliberation dialogues for each local conflict. Here partial global 
%planning bridges the gap between conventional decoupled approaches and 
%computational argumentation. The norm in cooperative pathfinding is to 
%calculate a global priority ordering. Partial global planning allows us to 
%create partial priority ordering that imply a global priority ordering.
In contrast to this abstract setting, potential applications like traffic management are more complex and 
can require domain-specific arguments. For example, in an air traffic control 
system the agents could make a sensible argument for being given a high priority if their fuel 
levels are low.
In such applications, such domain-dependent reasons can provide helpful additional explanations why a certain solution was 
arrived at. In the present abstract setting, such explanations are restricted to the inspection of the evaluations 
made during dialogues. Adapting our abstract algorithms to include domain-dependent arguments may prove a useful extension of the present research.
%In applications where specific arguments made during a dialogue play a larger 
%role in finding the eventual solution then these arguments can be used to 
%extract reasons for why the solution is the most appropriate.

\section{Conclusion}
We have combined ideas from cooperative pathfinding, computational 
argumentation and multi-agent planning to propose three algorithms PCA*, DPCA* and DPCA*+ that can 
find conflict-free paths for groups of mobile agents. Agents engage in 
dialogues to resolve conflicts in their individually optimal plans. By deliberation dialogues between two or more agents, the local views of 
agents are incrementally combined to form a global well-coordinated plan.
In contrast to other cooperative pathfinding algorithms it is possible for 
agents to motivate why they arrived at a particular solution.
Our algorithms are generally faster and can solve instances with more agents than a 
centralized state of the art algorithm and a recent decentralized algorithm.
We also found that agents resolving conflicts in pairs is slightly faster than 
solving them in larger groups.
